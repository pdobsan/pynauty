# Pynauty 

Pynauty can be used to compare graphs for isomorphism and to determine
their automorphism group in a Python programming environment.  Pynauty
is a Python/C extension module using library components from the
[Nauty](https://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/) package by Brendan McKay.

**Current version** under development: 1.0b1+nauty27r1

## Usage

Here is an example of `pynauty`'s usage in an interactive session.

```python
>>> from pynauty import *
>>> g = Graph(5)
>>> g.connect_vertex(0, [1, 2, 3])
>>> g.connect_vertex(2, [1, 3, 4])
>>> g.connect_vertex(4, [3])
>>> print(g)
Graph(number_of_vertices=5, directed=False,
 adjacency_dict = {
  0: [1, 2, 3],
  2: [1, 3, 4],
  4: [3],
 },
 vertex_coloring = [
 ],
)
>>> autgrp(g)
([[3, 4, 2, 0, 1]], 2.0, 0, [0, 1, 2, 0, 1], 3)
>>> 
>>> g.connect_vertex(1, [3])
>>> autgrp(g)
([[0, 1, 3, 2, 4], [1, 0, 2, 3, 4]], 4.0, 0, [0, 0, 2, 2, 4], 3)
>>>
>>> g.set_vertex_coloring([set([3])])
>>> print(g)
Graph(number_of_vertices=5, directed=False,
 adjacency_dict = {
  0: [1, 2, 3],
  1: [3],
  2: [1, 3, 4],
  4: [3],
 },
 vertex_coloring = [
  set([3]),
  set([0, 1, 2, 4]),
 ],
)
>>> autgrp(g)
([[1, 0, 2, 3, 4]], 2.0, 0, [0, 0, 2, 3, 4], 4)
>>>
```

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 - 3.9
- An ANSI C compiler 
- The most recent version of Nauty, currently `nauty27r1`.

### Building from source

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdobsan/pynauty
```

and change into the `pynauty/` directory created by the cloning.

Nauty's source code is not distributed with `pynauty`, however it is
automatically downloaded during the building process. 

To build and test the package:

```bash
make pynauty
make tests
```

Here is how to create a virtualenv and install `pynauty` into it.

```bash
% make virtenv-create
python3 -m venv .venv-pynauty
Created virtualenv: .venv-pynauty
To activate it type: source ./.venv-pynauty/bin/activate
% source .venv-pynauty/bin/activate
(.venv-pynauty) % make virtenv-ins
(.venv-pynauty) % make virtenv-tests
...
```

You can install `pynauty` into an already existing virtualenv just skip
the creation step above and activate your own virtualenv.

```bash
% source /.../my-virtenv/bin/activate
(my-virtenv) % make virtenv-ins
(my-virtenv) % make virtenv-tests
...
```

It is also possible to install the package in `~/.local` (home install) then
generate the documentation. Building the documentation from source requires the
Sphinx package.

```bash
make user-ins
make docs
```

Invoking `make` without arguments will list many more targets most of
them you unlikely need to use directly.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, API and User's Guide see the `docs/`
directory after building as above.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
