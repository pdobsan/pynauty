'''
pynauty  --  isomorphism testing and automorphism groups of graphs

A Python extension module to Brendan McKay's "nauty" C procedures
for determining the automorphism group of a vertex colored graph
and producing canonical labeling for isomorphism testing.

Classes:

    Graph   - An adjacency dictionary based graph object.
        Graph can represent vertex colored, directed or undirected graphs.

Functions:

    autgrp      - Compute the automorphism group of a graph.
    isomorphic  - Compare two graphs for isomorphism.
    certificate - Compute a "certificate" based on the canonical labeling
                  of the graph's vertices.
